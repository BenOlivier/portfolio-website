          <p>Horizon Workrooms is Meta's first party VR productivity solution which allows users to meet and collaborate in the same virtual space. This creates a sense of co-presence and physical connection that is impossible with 2D video calls.</p>
          <p>The app also includes solo productivity features. Users can work on up to three large virtual screens in VR or MR, effectively removing the need for physical multi-monitor setups.</p>

          <p>As a Product Design Prototyper on the Workrooms team it was my job was to design interactions, flows and features for the product. I would build fully functional prototypes of these in Unity so that they could be user tested and validated. Finally, working closely with engineering to see features implemented into the product and shipped.</p>
          <p>Beyond designing, it was necessary to take a high-level view to identify areas of product that should be worked on, building my influence over strategy, and taking ownership over parts of the product.</p>
